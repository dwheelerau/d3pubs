      The map shows the location of pubs that share the 100 most common
      names. The top 10 most popular pub names are shown in the table to the right.
      Need an excuse to get out and see this great big country of ours? Just enter
      your postcode in the box and we will find your nearest pubs from this top 10 list.
      The goal is to visit all of the pubs on your list and enjoy a middy, pot, 
      schooner, half pint, or ten. Enjoy (but please don't drink and drive)!
      Why not take a photo in front of your pub and share it on twitter with
      the hashtag #aussiepubchallange.

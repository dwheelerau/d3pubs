      The map shows the location of pubs that share the 100 most common
      names in Australia. The top 20 most popular pub names are shown in the table to the right.

      So do you need an excuse to get out and see this great big country of ours? If so enter 
      your postcode in the box and we will find your nearest pubs from the top 20 most
      popular name list. The goal is to visit all of the pubs on your list and enjoy a middy, pot, 
      schooner, half pint, or ten. Enjoy (but please don't drink and drive)!

      Why not take a photo in front of your pub and share it on twitter with the hashtag #aussiepubchallange.

      fuzzy as it was obtained by cross-referencing the pubs long/lat with postcode data.
